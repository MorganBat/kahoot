TODO: Error Handling, Documentation, randomise order of answers

## Statement of Purpose & Scope

This terminal app is a clone of the "Kahoot!" app we use for study reviews in class. Containing a bank of questions, it allows the user
to study as many or as few questions as they like.

## List of Features



## User Interaction

Upon running the program the user will be met with a Heading and prompt to enter how many questions they wish to answer. The maximum amount
of questions will be indicated. Should the user input a number outside that range or letters, the terminal will output an error and ask the user to try again 

Once the user has selected how many questions to answer, they will be brought to a screen which asks a question and has 4 potential answers - 
3 incorrect and 1 correct. Using CLI-UI the user can scroll through the answers with the up and down arrows and select by pressing the enter
key. The user can also type the corresponding number to select that answer.

Once an answer is selected the screen will indicate whether the user was correct or incorrect, and indicate their running score. At the end of
their selected questions, the user will be shown their total score and their percentage of questions answered correctly. They will then
be shown a prompt on whether to study another round or exit the program.
